# Tanzanian Water Well Functionality Classification.

Tanzania, as a developing country, struggles with providing clean water to its population of over 57,000,000. There are many water points already established in the country, but some are in need of repair while others have failed altogether. Using data from Taarifa and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water, we need to predict which pumps are functional, which need some repairs, and which donâ€™t work at all. A smart understanding of which water points will fail can improve maintenance operations and ensure that clean, potable water is available to communities across Tanzania.
